Summary
-------

A LaTeX package for managing the options and loading order of other packages


Prerequisites
-------------

To use this package, you need the following packages:

*  `lt3graph`

To generate the documentation some additional packages are needed.


Installation
-------------

`pkgloader.sty` is provided directly in the package archive. Put
it in a place where your LaTeX distribution can find it.
(`pkgloader.sty` is not generated, but manually maintained; you
 may use docstrip to remove the documentation, but you don't
 have to; it will just work the way it is)


Documentation
-------------

`pkgloader.pdf` is provided directly in the package archive. To
generate the documentation yourself, run LaTeX on pkgloader.tex.
(`pkgloader.tex` does not contain the package code itself; it inputs
 `pkgloader.sty` directly to document the implementation)
